        <h1>Political Contribution Policy</h1>

        <h2>Our Commitment to Transparency and Compliance</h2>
        <p>At <strong>Your Pharmacy</strong>, we believe in maintaining transparency and integrity in all aspects of our operations, including our political contributions. This policy outlines our guidelines for any political donations or involvement to ensure that all activities align with legal standards and reflect our commitment to ethical business practices.</p>

        <h2>1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations</h2>
        <p>All political contributions made by <strong>Your Pharmacy</strong> comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws. This includes following the guidelines set by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and other relevant regulatory bodies. We ensure that all contributions are fully transparent and reported as required by law.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All contributions are made in accordance with FEC regulations.</li>
            <li>We do not make political donations in jurisdictions where corporate contributions are prohibited by law.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. No Use of Company Funds for Personal Political Contributions</h2>
        <p>Your Pharmacy does not use corporate funds to support political campaigns or candidates for public office on behalf of individual employees. Any political donations made by employees are considered personal and should not be made in the name of the company.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not reimburse employees for political donations.</li>
            <li>Employees are free to make personal political contributions but must ensure that they are done independently of the company.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Contributions for Industry Advocacy and Public Policy</h2>
        <p>We may, from time to time, support industry trade associations, advocacy groups, or political action committees (PACs) that promote public policies aligned with the interests of healthcare and patient well-being. These contributions are reviewed carefully to ensure they are consistent with our mission and values.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We support policies that improve public health, patient access to medications, and the overall healthcare industry.</li>
            <li>We do not support contributions that would conflict with our commitment to ethical practices and transparency.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Reporting and Transparency</h2>
        <p>All political contributions made by <strong>Your Pharmacy</strong> are fully documented and disclosed as required by law. We maintain transparency in our political activities and ensure that our contributions are reported in our annual public disclosures or to relevant regulatory bodies.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All contributions are recorded and reviewed by our legal and compliance teams.</li>
            <li>We publicly disclose our contributions in accordance with applicable laws.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Employee Political Activities</h2>
        <p><strong>Your Pharmacy</strong> respects the rights of employees to engage in personal political activities and encourages civic participation. However, employees must ensure that their personal political activities are separate from their role at the company. Any political opinions or donations expressed by employees are their own and should not imply endorsement by the company.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Employees are not allowed to use company resources (such as time, email, or office supplies) for political activities.</li>
            <li>Political opinions shared on personal platforms (such as social media) should make clear that they do not represent the views of the company.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Lobbying Activities</h2>
        <p>We may engage in lobbying activities to influence public policy that affects our industry. Any lobbying efforts are conducted transparently, and in compliance with relevant lobbying laws. Our lobbying activities are focused on improving the healthcare landscape and advocating for policies that enhance patient care and safety.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All lobbying efforts are reviewed and conducted under legal oversight.</li>
            <li>We only advocate for policies that align with our mission to improve healthcare services.</li>
        </ul>
